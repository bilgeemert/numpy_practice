# NumPy Exercises
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook focused on practicing various tasks and operations using NumPy, a powerful library for numerical computations in Python. The exercises are designed to help reinforce fundamental concepts and functions within NumPy, providing hands-on experience with array manipulation, random number generation, broadcasting, and more.

## Overview
The notebook includes a series of exercises, each targeting different aspects of NumPy's functionality. These exercises are inspired by the NumPy quick introduction tutorial, and they cover the following topics:
#### * Creating NumPy Arrays: 
Learn how to create 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays using np.array().
#### * Array Attributes: 
Explore the properties of arrays, including shape, size, data type, and dimensions.
#### * Array Operations:
Perform various operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on arrays.
#### * Random Number Generation: 
Generate arrays of random integers and floats using NumPy's random module.
#### * Array Indexing and Slicing: 
Practice selecting elements from arrays using different indexing methods.
#### * Mathematical Functions: 
Apply functions like np.mean(), np.max(), np.min(), np.std(), and np.var() to arrays.
#### * Array Reshaping and Transposing: 
Learn how to reshape and transpose arrays to perform operations like dot products.
#### * Comparison Operations: 
Compare arrays using operators like >, >=, ==, and explore methods like np.argmax() and np.argmin().
#### * Sorting: 
Sort arrays and find indices of sorted elements.
#### * Advanced Topics: 
Work with broadcasting, creating arrays with evenly spaced values, and generating normally distributed random numbers.
